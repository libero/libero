## Libero MVP Hypothesis statement



Our mission is to help scientists accelerate discovery by operating a platform for research communication that encourages and recognises the most responsible behaviours in science.
With Libero, we want to have an impact on scholarly publishing and demonstrate that our technology is reusable. We will know if there is a potential market fit for Libero when our MVP has confirmed the following 3 hypothesis:

### Hypothesis #1
A simple journal can adopt Libero to publish their articles once our MVP is available.

### Hypothesis #2
Libero provides a platform that can be extended so that larger, more complex journals can publish their articles using the platform.

### Hypothesis #3
Libero can help journals lower their infrastructure and maintenance costs compared to dominant commercial platforms.
