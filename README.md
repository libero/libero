## Libero Publisher MVP Hypothesis statement



eLife's mission is to help scientists accelerate discovery by operating a platform for research communication that encourages and recognises the most responsible behaviours in science.
With Libero Publisher, we want to have an impact on scholarly publishing and demonstrate that our technology is reusable. We will know if there is a potential market fit for Libero Publisher when our MVP has confirmed the following 3 hypothesis:

### Hypothesis #1
A __simple__ journal can adopt Libero to publish their articles once our MVP is available.

### Hypothesis #2
Libero provides a platform that can be extended so that larger, more __complex__ journals can publish their articles using the platform.

### Hypothesis #3
Libero can help journals lower their infrastructure and maintenance costs compared to dominant commercial platforms. 


### Definitions of a simple or complex journal
To help define a __simple__ or __complex__ journal we have looked at the differences in technology that would be required to produce Libero to publish and host different types of journal.

A __simple__ journal is defined as having a low throughput of articles (less than 1 per week), a low amount of visitors (less than 50,000 a month) and displays only scholarly content that is uncomplicated in nature so supports only text, images, tables and mathematical forumlas. Articles are grouped by research category and one other way (collections, issues etc.).

Examples might include [The International Journal of Microsimulation](http://www.microsimulation.org/ijm/), [Bioinorganic Chemistry and Applications](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bca/) or small society journals.

A __complex__ journal is defined as having higher throughput (greater than 25 articles per week), a significant amount of visitors (greater than 500,000 a month) and scholarly content that is more complicated containing items like videos, IIIF images and custom sections (like plain language summaries or decision letters). Articles are supported by other editorial content, blog posts and news, and might be grouped in multiple ways including special editions, cross discipline collections or through specific channels.

Examples might include [eLife](https://elifesciences.org), [The BMJ](http://www.thebmj.com) or large society journals.
